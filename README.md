# white file
i created this repo based in one of cidada 3301 enigma, its convert any type of file in a binary file then replacing 1 and 0 to tab and space saving in a .white file.
since its convert bits to char, the white file is about 8x bigger and i don't recomend for any serius usage  

# Usage:
write.exe: drag and drop any file in the executable to receive a white version of the file 
read.exe: open a file with them or just drag and drop
~
# examples:
hello world:
